    "We all know that movie industry is risky, but it can also bring enormous profit at the same time. That's why countless companies and people have been attracted to this industry. However, how risky is it? We all saw super hits like Titanic, and we all have seen big productions fail. There hasn't been an universal formula to make a popular movie, but it is always to our interest to choose the right movie to invest in. Personaly, I would also like to find out how to prevent the emergence of bad movies: that is how to identify them before they even started shooting.\n",

    "In this analysis, I aim to produce a study to figure out specific reasons that lead to the success of a movie economically, and give advices for companies or individuals who want to enter this industry. In other words, I decided to explore how to select a movie that will be successful economically to invest in for companies and individuls who want to make a profit in this field."
